# ShodanAPI
A script that uses the shodan api just as the website uses it.
Once the script is downloaded, you need to open the script with a text editor and add your Shodan API key which you can get from viewing your shodan account.
The installing of the requirements is done by the script itself, so all you will need is python3.
The script asks for search criteria, to find ip addresses of whatever criteria  you enter. It then returns either a list or lots of ips with info about the target based on user input. Then it can open the ip address in the browser from the script, and before it opens it checks if the web server is a honeypot to avoid getting caught up in that. Have fun exploring the IOT of the planet!
