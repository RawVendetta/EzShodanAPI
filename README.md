# ShodanAPI
A script that uses the shodan api just as the website uses it.
The installing of the requirements is done by the script itself, so all you will need is python3 and pip.
The script asks for search criteria, to find ip addresses of whatever criteria  you enter. It then returns either a list or lots of ips with info about the target based on user input. Then it can open the ip address in the browser from the script, and before it opens it checks if the web server is a honeypot to avoid monitorization. Have fun exploring the IOT of the planet!

<h4><u>Easy Setup!</u></h5><br>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
~just copy and paste :)<br>
git clone https://github.com/RawVendetta/EzShodanAPI<br>
cd EzShodanAPI<br>
cd ShodanAPI<br>
*open add add your API key which is under a comment(#) at the beginning called #[!]Shodan API key: then the variable for your key. paste the key in between the commas. note, you will not be able to search without an api key, you will get an error.<br>
*note you can now just run the script as long as the community api key has queried left!
python3 ShodanSearchv2-0.py<br>
