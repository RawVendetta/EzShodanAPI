# ShodanAPI
A script that uses the shodan api just as the website uses it.
Once the script is downloaded, you need to open the script with a text editor and add your Shodan API key which you can get from viewing your shodan account.
The installing of the requirements is done by the script itself, so all you will need is python3.

Steps:
~just copy and paste :)
git clone https://github.com/RawVendetta/ShodanAPI
cd ShodanAPI
*open add add your API key
python3 ShodanSearchv1-9.py
